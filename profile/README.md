## Welcome to the github space of the @AMRmicrobiology group from ISGlobal 👋

🙋‍♀️ [ISGlobal](https://www.isglobal.org/en/quienes-somos)'s mission is to improve global health and promote health equity through excellence in research and the translation and application of knowledge. Our [research group](https://www.isglobal.org/en/resistencia-antimicrobiana) focuses on the molecular bases of microbial resistance on multiple clinical multiresistant bacteria.

👩‍💻 Below you can find a compilation of curated pipelines built using [Nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/) aimed to ease the research on antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs) in clinical strains.
